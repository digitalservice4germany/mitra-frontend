# 2. Use TypeScript for frontend

Date: 2021-10-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application must run in a browser without relying on a central backend server for its core functionalities. The application will have a lot of business logic in the browser client.

## Decision

We will use TypeScript for the frontend.

## Consequences

We will have static typing and better compile-time safety.
